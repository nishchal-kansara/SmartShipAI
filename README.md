# SmartShipAI - Fuel Consumption and CO₂ Emissions Prediction
AI-powered predictive analytics for ship fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions

## Project Overview
The SmartShipAI aims to predict how much fuel ships consume and how much CO₂ they emit using AI. By leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning, we aim to provide insights into fuel efficiency, environmental impacts, and optimization strategies for maritime operations.

We chose SmartShipAI because shipping is a major but less-noticed contributor to global pollution. Everyone talks about cars or factories, but ships also emit huge amounts of carbon. And no one is really using AI to solve this in a simple, predictive way.

<strong>"Shipping is responsible for nearly 3% of global CO₂ emissions. It's less explored in AI projects."</strong>

## Wow Factor in Solution
We are not just analyzing data - we're using AI to build a smart, predictive model that helps the maritime industry reduce fuel use and CO₂ emissions. The wow factor lies in how we combine environmental impact with real-world machine learning to create a scalable solution for green shipping.
1. Dual prediction of both fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions.
2. Considers multiple real-world factors like weather, engine efficiency, and fuel type
3. Uses ML Models for better accuracy and pattern detection
4. Underexplored domain: Very few AI solutions focus on shipping emissions
5. Can be turned into a decision-support tool for logistics, ports, and government bodies

## Our Mission
Our mission is to empower shipping companies with accurate, AI-driven predictions that help reduce fuel consumption, lower operational costs, and minimize environmental impact. By making these tools accessible and user-friendly, we aim to drive the maritime industry toward a more sustainable future.

## Conclusion
The SmartShipAI is designed to help the maritime industry become smarter and more eco-friendly. By using machine learning, our model accurately predicts a ship’s fuel consumption and CO₂ emissions based on real factors like ship type, fuel type, distance, weather, and month. This helps shipping companies plan better, reduce fuel waste, and cut down harmful emissions.

Our goal is to bring awareness to the environmental impact of ships, which is often ignored compared to cars and factories. With this tool, ports, logistics teams, and government agencies can make informed decisions to improve sustainability in shipping. Overall, SmartShipAI is a simple yet powerful solution that supports green technology and smarter transport using artificial intelligence.
